This is the inaugural post for the **sensorhive** website. A website [I've](https://supakeen.com) set up to organise and document how I collect and present sensor data at home. Over time this website will slowly grow a few projects and tutorial posts.

You can check out the [sensorhive github](https://github.com/sensorhive) as that's where projects will appear first.
